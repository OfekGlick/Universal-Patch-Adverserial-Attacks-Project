# Universal-Patch-Adverserial-Attacks-Project
Deep Learning final project

Need to do:
1. Cross validation- 3 sets train,1  eval and 1 test.
2. Find a way to somehow create a path from the cross validation (as every train and eval will create pertubation). Don't use mean!
One idea is to use the pertubation with the highest ratio between it to clean.
3. Find a way to use the rotation matrix in the loss critria.
4. Test the ADAM optimizer preformance in the current setting.
